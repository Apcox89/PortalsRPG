/*
 * Andy Cox
 * SD725-Final Project
 * "Portals of Technoprolis" Action-Rpg text version.
 * 
 * This simple program allows a player to assign a name to their Character.
 * Once named, the character is equipped with an initial weapon, and faces an npc-battle.
 * 
 * If they pass the battle, they earn the chance to assign a skill to their Character.
 * 
 * The project demonstrates Inhertiance of class objects,
 * using simple loops, constraining the user input, and allowing the user to do something
 * when they complete a task. The task completion allows for a skill assignment
 * using the "Strategy" design gang-of-four module imported and modified from HW-7.
 * 
 * In the fully-fleshed out action-rpg version, there will be many npcs.
 * This is simply to demo what is required for the final-project and scope of the course.
 * 
 * The System.Collections.Generic API is integrated into the type <T> lists used to 
 * assign values from Player-GameEnvironment interaction. That is demonstrated
 * at ln150 where the Skill chosen by the Player dynamically is assigned to their Skill-class.
